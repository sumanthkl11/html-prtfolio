<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am determined to be cheerful and happy in whatever situation I may find myself.For I have learned that the
   greater part of our misery or unhappiness is determined not by our circumstance but by our disposition.
   Love myself I do. Not everything, but I love the good as well as the bad. I love my crazy lifestyle, 
   and I love my hard discipline. I love my freedom of speech and the way my eyes get dark when I'm tired.
    I love that I have learned to trust people with my heart, even if it will get broken. I am proud of
     everything that I am and will become.   </p>

<p>Being real is what keeps me humble. It doesn't matter how much money I make or how much I accomplish.
   What's critical is staying real to myself and keeping my feet on the ground. That's what helps keep me going.
   When I made 'Real,' I recorded it over the phone in prison. I did it in a week. I had no idea what it was going
    to sound like. I couldn't even listen to the masters before it came out, I couldn't listen to 90% of the beats.
     I recorded 21 songs in seven days.</p>

<p>Some days are just bad days, that's all. You have to experience sadness to know happiness, and I remind myself
 that not every day is going to be a good day, that's just the way it is! The happiness of your life depends upon 
 the quality of your thoughts: therefore, guard accordingly, and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable
  to virtue and reasonable nature.</p>
